The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing. \n\nViral pneumona is caused by a virus, therefore, antibiotics are NOT helpful. Remember, prescribing antibiotics when it is not necessary can actually do more harm than good (side-effects of antibiotics, allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance).\n\nThe child needs rest and should drink enough fluids.

Of note, few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nIf the patient will be self-isolated at home, the following recommendations should be followed:\n- Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (ideally in a different room from others)\n- Limit movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space (keep windows open) if sharing space.\n- Wash hands after any type of contact with the patient or their immediate environment.\n- A mask should be worn as much as possible by the patient.\n- Caregivers should wear a mask when in the same room as the patient.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids (oral respiratory secretions, and stool).\n- Avoid sharing potentially contaminated items (toothbrushes, eating utensils, towels, bed linen, washcloths, clothes)\n\nAdvise close contacts of the patient that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and must seek care if they develop symptoms and wear face masks and wash hands.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to limit transmission to vulnerable close-contacts, such as those with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, HIV), and the elderly (>= 60 years).\n\nREF: WHO/2019-nCov/IPC/HomeCare/2020.3"

In children, it is commonly caused viruses, but sometimes caused by a bacteria. With the infection, small airways become swollen and produce more mucus. This can reduce the amount of oxygen that goes to the body. Pneumonia can appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing, sometimes chest pain or abdominal pain. \n\nBacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. The child may continue to cough for up to 3 weeks after treatment, this can be normal if the child is otherwise getting better. \"",

No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nRepeat up to 3 times every 15 minutes before classifying pneumonia.\nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.\n(REF IMCI 2014)"

Antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Untreated, it can sometimes result in irreversible bone/ joint damage, sepsis and even death.  \n\nDiagnosis of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is complicated. Elevated CRP may help distinguish ostemoyelitis and septic arthritis from less severe acute limp or joint pain, and those needing antibiotics.",

The incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted.\n– Be cautious when excising an abscess located over a blood vessel (carotid, axillary, humeral, femoral, popliteal).\n\nDigital exploration:\n– Explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus and explore to the edges of the cavity.\n– The exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical advice.\n\nWashing:\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with antiseptic solution.\n\nDrainage:\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\n\nREF MSF Clinical Guidelines"

        "description": "Urticaria (hives) are slightly raised, flesh coloured patches of the skin. They occur in groups on any part of the body and can look like mosquito bites. They are often very itchy. Hives are very common and usually caused by an allergic reaction, by chemicals in foods, medicines and plants or by a viral infection. This leads to a release of a chemical called histamine. Often, urticaria is caused by multiple triggers rather than one single cause. Often, a specific cause is not identified. The single patches last around 24 hours or less before fading without a trace. They can reappear at other sites of the body, but should resolve completely within 6 weeks. \nREF Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne fact sheets",

Sometimes, these areas of skin can become cracked, weepy and then scab over. There is no cure for eczema, but there are many ways to keep eczema under control and help the child feel more comfortable. \nThe severity of eczema can change over time. Secondary bacterial or viral skin infections may occur. \nThe cause of eczema is not known, but if a familiy member has eczema, asthma or hay fever, it is more likely that the child will have eczema. Some children with eczema may also develop asthma or hay fever. Eczema can be triggered by overheating (clothing, heaters), irritation from soaps or detergents, food allergies, plant pollens, animal fur, viruses. \n\nREF: Royal Children's Hospital of Melbourne Fact sheets\"",

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea.

However, they should still be encouraged to eat the types of food recommended for their age, as often as recommended, even if they do not eat much. They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

Four species of plasmodia can cause malaria, but the most dangerous one is Plasmodium falciparum. Fever is the main symptom of malaria. It can be present all the time or go away and return at regular intervals. Other signs of falciparum malaria are shivering, sweating, vomiting or chronic anemia. Signs of malaria can overlap with signs of other illnesses like pneumonia or diarrhea. \nA case of uncomplicated malaria can develop into severe malaria as soon as 24 hours after the fever first appears. Severe malaria is malaria with complications such as cerebral malaria or severe anemia. The child can die if he does not receive urgent treatment.  Antibiotics are not needed, and are not helpful for uncomplicated malaria.\"",
