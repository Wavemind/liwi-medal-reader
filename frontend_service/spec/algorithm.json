Give the following information. \n\nTell the mother:\n\n• Her child will start eating normally sooner if she paints the mouth ulcers in her child’s mouth. It is important that the child eats. \n• Clean the child’s mouth. Wrap a clean soft cloth around her finger. Dip it in salt water. Wipe the mouth.\n • Use a clean cloth or a cotton-tipped stick to paint gentian violet on the mouth ulcers. The gentian violet will kill germs that cause the ulcers. Put a small amount of gentian violet on the cloth or stick. Do not let the child drink the gentian violet.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers 2 times per day, in the morning and evening.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers for 5 days and then stop.\n\nWrap a clean cloth around your finger and dip it into salt water. Show the mother how to first wipe the child’s mouth clean. Then paint half of the child’s mouth with halfstrength gentian violet.\n\nAsk the mother to practise.

The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"}},"excluding_final_diagnostics":[],"excluded_final_diagnostics":[3493],"cc":3485,"instances":{"2986":{"top_conditions":[],"conditions":[],"id":2986,"children":[1769,2082],"final_diagnostic_id":3492},"2028":{"top_conditions":[],"conditions":[],"id":2028,"children":[1769,1808],"final_diagnostic_id":3492}}}}},"1736":{"id":1736,"label":"YI - Omphalitis","complaint_category":2095,"instances":{"2971":{"top_conditions":[],"conditions":[],"id":2971,"children":[2219,2214,2215,2223,2207,2220,3550,3503,3258],"final_diagnostic_id":3287},"3291":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2530,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3289,"score":null},{"first_id":2528,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3288,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3291,"children":[3286,3287],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"3290":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2528,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3288,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3290,"children":[3286,3287],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"3289":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2291,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3002,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3289,"children":[2170,2169,3291],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"3288":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2291,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3002,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3288,"children":[2170,2169,3291,3290],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"3002":{"top_conditions":[],"conditions":[],"id":3002,"children":[3289,3288],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"2169":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2530,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3289,"score":null},{"first_id":2528,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3288,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":2169,"children":[3286,3287],"final_diagnostic_id":null},"2170":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2530,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3289,"score":null},{"first_id":2528,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3288,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":2170,"children":[3286,3287],"final_diagnostic_id":null}},"final_diagnostics":{"3287":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":1083,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2169,"score":null},{"first_id":1085,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2170,"score":null},{"first_id":2534,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3291,"score":null},{"first_id":2532,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3290,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"diagnostic_id":1736,"id":3287,"label":"Omphalitis complicated / severe","description":null,"level_of_urgency":5,"medias":[],"type":"FinalDiagnostic","drugs":{"3550":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2252,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2971,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3550,"duration":"1","description":""},"3503":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2252,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2971,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3503,"duration":"1","description":""},"3258":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2253,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2971,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":3258,"duration":"5","description":"Antibiotic for skin infection"}},"managements":{"2219":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2253,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2971,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":2219,"duration":"","description":"Teach the mother how to treat local infections at home.

Weight (kg)","description":"It is very important to measure weight at every visit, to be able to calculate the correct treatment dose, and to identify children at risk of severe malnutrition. If it is not possible to measure the weight look at the clinic card (health card) to see the last measured weight. \n\nThe acceptable estimated weight by age group are:\nAge 2m - 12m (weight within 1 month acceptable);\nAge 1-5y (weight within 2 months acceptable);\nAge \u003e5y (weight within 3 months acceptable\n\nWEIGHT MEASUREMENT  INSTRUCTIONS:\nEnsure that the scale is placed on a flat, hard, even surface. Babies should be wrapped in a blanket and unwrapped when weighed. Weigh older children with minimal clothing as social acceptability allows.\n1. If the child is less than 2 years old, or is older than 2 years old and will not stand still on the scale, do tared weighing with the caregiver:\na. Zero the scale\nb. Have the caregiver remove their shoes, step on the scale (without the baby) with feet slightly apart, and zero the scale again.\nc. Unwrap the baby and hand the baby to the caregiver.\nd. The weight that appears should be that of the baby.\ne. Note: If the caregiver is heavy (\u003e100kg), the baby’s weight may not be accurate. It may be more accurate to involve a lighter individual for tared weighing instead.\n2. If the child is more than 2 years old and will stand still on the scale:\na. Ask the caregiver to remove the child’s shoes and outer clothing. Talk with the child about the need to stand still.\nb. Zero the scale.\nc. Ask the child to stand in the middle of the scale with their feet slightly apart.\nd.

neck","description":"LOOK OR FEEL FOR STIFF NECK\n\nA child with fever and stiff neck may have meningitis. A child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to hospital.\n\nWhile you talk with the mother during the assessment, look to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiff neck.\n\nIf you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.\n\nIf you still have not seen the child bend his neck himself, ask the mother to help you lie the child on his back. Lean over the child, gently support his back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold his head. Then carefully bend the head forward toward his chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck. Often a child with a stiff neck will cry when you try to bend the neck.

pinch","description":"\"This skin pinch tests is an important tool for testing dehydration. When a child is dehydrated, the skin loses elasticity. \n\nTo assess dehydration using the skin pinch: \n1.ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap.\n2.USE  YOUR  THUMB  AND  FIRST  FINGER  to  locate  the  area  on  the  child’s  abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5. LOOK  to  see  if  the  skin  pinch  goes  back  very  slowly  (more  than  2  seconds),  slowly (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In a child is overweight or has oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. However you should still use it to classify the child’s dehydration.

When a child is dehydrated, the skin loses elasticity. \n\nTo assess dehydration using the skin pinch: \n1.ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap.\n2.USE  YOUR  THUMB  AND  FIRST  FINGER  to  locate  the  area  on  the  child’s  abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5. LOOK  to  see  if  the  skin  pinch  goes  back  very  slowly  (more  than  2  seconds),  slowly (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In a child is overweight or has oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. However you should still use it to classify the child’s dehydration.

This means that antibiotics may not work when they are really needed. \nReassure the patient and caretaker that antibiotics are not needed, and remind them of when to return to consultation if the child presents new symptoms, or does not get better.","excluding_nodes_ids":[],"excluded_nodes_ids":[],"level_of_urgency":4,"medias":[]},"3772":{"id":3772,"type":"HealthCare","category":"management","label":"Consider outpatient referral for asthma assessment","description":"If the patient has presented many episodes of reactive airway disease, he/she should be assessed for asthma.","excluding_nodes_ids":[],"excluded_nodes_ids":[],"level_of_urgency":8,"medias":[]},"1814":{"id":1814,"type":"HealthCare","category":"management","label":"Advise on proper inhaler use","description":"Give Inhaled Salbutamol or Budesonide for difficult breathing (wheezing)\nUSE OF A SPACER*\nA spacer is a way of delivering the bronchodilator drugs effectively into the lungs.
