With the infection, small airways become swollen and produce more mucus. This can reduce the amount of oxygen that goes to the body. Pneumonia can appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing, sometimes chest pain or abdominal pain. \n\nBacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. The child may continue to cough for up to 3 weeks after treatment, this can be normal if the child is otherwise getting better. \"",

Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.\n(REF IMCI 2014)"

(= Urinary tract infection that affect the upper urinary tract). The younger the child, the less specific the symptoms are. Infants and young children often present unspecific symptoms including fever, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability. Older children and adolescents have more typical symptoms such as dysuria, abdominal pain, costovertebral tenderness and fever. Untreated pyelonephritis can lead to severe conditions including urosepsis and renal scarring leading to arterial hypertension in the long term. ",

Antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Untreated, it can sometimes result in irreversible bone/ joint damage, sepsis and even death.  \n\nDiagnosis of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is complicated. Elevated CRP may help distinguish ostemoyelitis and septic arthritis from less severe acute limp or joint pain, and those needing antibiotics.",

Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

However, they should still be encouraged to eat the types of food recommended for their age, as often as recommended, even if they do not eat much. They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea.

          "description": "Urticaria (hives) are slightly raised, red patches of the skin. Thy occur in groups on any part of the body and can look like mosquito bites. They are often very itchy. Hives are very common and usually caused by an allergic reaction, by chemicals in foods, medicines and plants or by a viral infection. This leads to a release of a chemical called histamine. Often, urticaria is caused by multiple triggers rather than one single cause. Often, a specific cause is not identified. The single patches last around 24 hours or less before fading without a trace. They can reappear at other sites of the body, but should resolve completely within 6 weeks. \nREF Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne fact sheets",

Sometimes, these areas of skin can become cracked, weepy and then scab over. There is no cure for eczema, but there are many ways to keep eczema under control and help the child feel more comfortable. \nThe severity of eczema can change over time. Secondary bacterial or viral skin infections may occur. \nThe cause of eczema is not known, but if a familiy member has eczema, asthma or hay fever, it is more likely that the child will have eczema. Some children with eczema may also develop asthma or hay fever. Eczema can be triggered by overheating (clothing, heaters), irritation from soaps or detergents, food allergies, plant pollens, animal fur, viruses. \n\nREF: Royal Children's Hospital of Melbourne Fact sheets\"",

              "description": "\"The child may be eating much less, or eating different foods during illness. Children often lose their appetite during illness. However, they should still be encouraged to eat the types of food recommended for their age, as often as recommended, even if they do not eat much. They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

Four species of plasmodia can cause malaria, but the most dangerous one is Plasmodium falciparum. Fever is the main symptom of malaria. It can be present all the time or go away and return at regular intervals. Other signs of falciparum malaria are shivering, sweating, vomiting or chronic anemia. Signs of malaria can overlap with signs of other illnesses like pneumonia or diarrhea. \nA case of uncomplicated malaria can develop into severe malaria as soon as 24 hours after the fever first appears. Severe malaria is malaria with complications such as cerebral malaria or severe anemia. The child can die if he does not receive urgent treatment.  Antibiotics are not needed, and are not helpful for uncomplicated malaria.\"",

Of note, few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nIf the patient will be self-isolated at home, the following recommendations should be followed:\n- Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (ideally in a different room from others)\n- Limit movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space (keep windows open) if sharing space.\n- Wash hands after any type of contact with the patient or their immediate environment.\n- A mask should be worn as much as possible by the patient.\n- Caregivers should wear a mask when in the same room as the patient.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids (oral respiratory secretions, and stool).\n- Avoid sharing potentially contaminated items (toothbrushes, eating utensils, towels, bed linen, washcloths, clothes)\n\nAdvise close contacts of the patient that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and must seek care if they develop symptoms and wear face masks and wash hands.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to limit transmission to vulnerable close-contacts, such as those with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, HIV), and the elderly (>= 60 years).\n\nREF: WHO/2019-nCov/IPC/HomeCare/2020.3"

Please follow local guidelines in order for the patient to be refered to a designated COVID-19 health facility, community facility or at home (self-isolation). \n\nAntibiotics are not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 (unless there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection). Of note, few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nIf the patient will be self-isolated at home, the following recommendations should be followed:\n- Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (ideally in a different room from others)\n- Limit movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space (keep windows open) if sharing space.\n- Wash hands after any type of contact with the patient or their immediate environment.\n- A mask should be worn as much as possible by the patient.\n- Caregivers should wear a mask when in the same room as the patient.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids (oral respiratory secretions, and stool).\n- Avoid sharing potentially contaminated items (toothbrushes, eating utensils, towels, bed linen, washcloths, clothes)\n\nAdvise close contacts of the patient that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and must seek care if they develop symptoms and wear face masks and wash hands.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to limit transmission to vulnerable close-contacts, such as those with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, HIV), and the elderly (>= 60 years).\n\nREF: WHO/2019-nCov/IPC/HomeCare/2020.3"

It protects the baby from many Illnesses. Breastfeed day and night, as often as your baby wants, at least 8 times in 24 hours. Frequent feeding produces more milk. If your baby is small (low birth weight), feed him or her at least every\n2 to 3 hours. Wake the baby for feeding after 3 hours, if she or he does not wake. DO NOT give other foods or fluids. Breast milk is all your baby needs. This is especially important for infants of HIV-positive mothers. Mixed feeding increases the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV over that with breastfeeding."

Conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva, the inside surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eye. If you do not see pus draining from the eye, look for pus on the conjunctiva or on the eyelids. Often the pus forms a crust when the child is sleeping and seals the eye shut. You can gently open the eye, making sure that your hands are clean. Wash your hands after examining the eye of any child with pus draining from the eye. ",

After proper use, assess if there is a subjective improvement (child describes an improvement of breathing) or objective improvement (respiratory rate reduces, or chest indrawing stops)\n\nUSE OF A SPACER*\nA spacer is a way of delivering the bronchodilator drugs effectively into the lungs. No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.",

The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing, sometimes chest pain or abdominal pain. \n\nBacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. The child may continue to cough for up to 3 weeks after treatment, this can be normal if the child is otherwise getting better. \"",

With the infection, small airways become swollen and produce more mucus. This can reduce the amount of oxygen that goes to the body. Pneumonia can appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing. \n\nViral pneumona is caused by a virus, therefore, antibiotics are NOT helpful. Remember, prescribing antibiotics when it is not necessary can actually do more harm than good (side-effects of antibiotics, allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance).\n\nThe child needs rest and should drink enough fluids. The child may continue to cough for up to 3 weeks after treatment, this can be normal if the child is otherwise getting better. \"",

Remove the dipstick from the solution and place it in a horizontal position.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n-        Read results within 5 minutes. Do not pay attention to any lines appearing later than 5 minutes. \n-        The red (control) line confirms the correct performance of the test.\n-        If, in addition to the red control line there are\no        no blue lines, the serum CRP concentration of the sample is <10 mg/l\no        one blue line, the serum CRP concentration is 10-40 mg/l\no        two blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is 40-80 mg/l\no        three blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is >80 mg/l\n-        If the red (control) line does not appear, the test is invalid and the test must be performed again.\n-        Document the results of the test as per usual health facility procedures with the result CRP <10mg/l, CRP 10-40mg/l, or CRP >80mg/l",

In children, it is commonly caused viruses, but sometimes caused by a bacteria. With the infection, small airways become swollen and produce more mucus. This can reduce the amount of oxygen that goes to the body. Pneumonia can appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. The symptoms include fever, cough and fast/difficult breathing, sometimes chest pain or abdominal pain. \n\nBacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. The child may continue to cough for up to 3 weeks after treatment, this can be normal if the child is otherwise getting better. \"",

      "description": "The cornea is usually clear. When clouding of the cornea is present, the cornea may appear clouded or hazy. The cornea may look the way a glass of water looks when you add a small amount of milk. The clouding may occur in one or both eyes. \nCorneal clouding is a dangerous condition. It may be the result of vitamin A deficiency that has been made worse by measles. If the corneal clouding is not treated, the cornea can ulcerate and cause blindness. \nA child with clouding of the cornea needs urgent treatment with vitamin A. A  child  with  corneal  clouding  may  keep  his  or  her  eyes  tightly  shut  when  exposed  to  light.  The  light  may  cause  irritation and pain to the child’s eyes. To check the child’s eye, wait for the child to open his or her eye. Or gently pull down the lower eyelid to look for clouding.\nIf there is clouding of the cornea, ask the caregiver how long the clouding has been present. If the caregiver is certain that clouding has been there for some time, ask if the clouding has already been assessed and treated at the hospital. If it has, you do not need to refer this child again for corneal clouding.",

Koplik spots occur in the mouth inside the cheek during early stages of the measles infection. Koplik spots are small, irregular, bright red spots with a white spot in the centre. They do not interfere with drinking or eating. They do not need treatment. ",

      "description": "LOOK OR FEEL FOR STIFF NECK\n\nA child with fever and stiff neck may have meningitis. A child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to hospital.\n\nWhile you talk with the mother during the assessment, look to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiff neck.\n\nIf you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.\n\nIf you still have not seen the child bend his neck himself, ask the mother to help you lie the child on his back. Lean over the child, gently support his back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold his head. Then carefully bend the head forward toward his chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck. Often a child with a stiff neck will cry when you try to bend the neck. REF WHO IMCI Handbook 2005",

Both infections are usually caused by spread of a bacteria (S. aureus in older children, K. kingae, H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae or S. pyogenes in younger children) through the blood. Antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Untreated, it can sometimes result in irreversible bone/ joint damage, sepsis and even death.  \n\nDiagnosis of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is complicated. Elevated CRP may help distinguish ostemoyelitis and septic arthritis from less severe acute limp or joint pain, and those needing antibiotics.",

Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

          "description": "Technique\n\n– Settle the patient comfortably in an area with good lighting and ensure all the necessary material is prepared.\n– Explain the procedure to the patient and ensure his co-operation.\n– If the patient is a young child, arrange to have an assistant hold the child if necessary.\nInitial cleaning\n\n– Wear suitable clothing: sterile gloves for all wounds and a gown and protective glasses if there is a risk of projection from a bleeding wound.\n– Start by washing the wound, prolong the cleaning if the wound is particularly soiled. Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Hold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. The scalpel blade should be perpendicular to the skin.\n– The incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. The incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted.\n– Be cautious when excising an abscess located over a blood vessel (carotid, axillary, humeral, femoral, popliteal).\n\nDigital exploration:\n– Explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus and explore to the edges of the cavity.\n– The exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical advice.\n\nWashing:\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with antiseptic solution.\n\nDrainage:\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\n\nREF MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Hold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. The scalpel blade should be perpendicular to the skin.\n– The incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. The incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted.\n– Be cautious when excising an abscess located over a blood vessel (carotid, axillary, humeral, femoral, popliteal).\n\nDigital exploration:\n– Explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus and explore to the edges of the cavity.\n– The exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical advice.\n\nWashing:\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with antiseptic solution.\n\nDrainage:\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\n\nREF MSF Clinical Guidelines"

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

Hives are very common and usually caused by an allergic reaction, by chemicals in foods, medicines and plants or by a viral infection. This leads to a release of a chemical called histamine. Often, urticaria is caused by multiple triggers rather than one single cause. Often, a specific cause is not identified. The single patches last around 24 hours or less before fading without a trace. They can reappear at other sites of the body, but should resolve completely within 6 weeks. \nREF Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne fact sheets",

Sometimes, these areas of skin can become cracked, weepy and then scab over. There is no cure for eczema, but there are many ways to keep eczema under control and help the child feel more comfortable. \nThe severity of eczema can change over time. Secondary bacterial or viral skin infections may occur. \nThe cause of eczema is not known, but if a familiy member has eczema, asthma or hay fever, it is more likely that the child will have eczema. Some children with eczema may also develop asthma or hay fever. Eczema can be triggered by overheating (clothing, heaters), irritation from soaps or detergents, food allergies, plant pollens, animal fur, viruses. \n\nREF: Royal Children's Hospital of Melbourne Fact sheets\"",

Four species of plasmodia can cause malaria, but the most dangerous one is Plasmodium falciparum. Fever is the main symptom of malaria. It can be present all the time or go away and return at regular intervals. Other signs of falciparum malaria are shivering, sweating, vomiting or chronic anemia. Signs of malaria can overlap with signs of other illnesses like pneumonia or diarrhea. \nA case of uncomplicated malaria can develop into severe malaria as soon as 24 hours after the fever first appears. Severe malaria is malaria with complications such as cerebral malaria or severe anemia. The child can die if he does not receive urgent treatment.  Antibiotics are not needed, and are not helpful for uncomplicated malaria.\"",

However, they should still be encouraged to eat the types of food recommended for their age, as often as recommended, even if they do not eat much. They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

Please follow local guidelines in order for the patient to be refered to a designated COVID-19 health facility, community facility or at home (self-isolation). \n\nAntibiotics are not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 (unless there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection). Of note, few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nIf the patient will be self-isolated at home, the following recommendations should be followed:\n- Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (ideally in a different room from others)\n- Limit movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space (keep windows open) if sharing space.\n- Wash hands after any type of contact with the patient or their immediate environment.\n- A mask should be worn as much as possible by the patient.\n- Caregivers should wear a mask when in the same room as the patient.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids (oral respiratory secretions, and stool).\n- Avoid sharing potentially contaminated items (toothbrushes, eating utensils, towels, bed linen, washcloths, clothes)\n\nAdvise close contacts of the patient that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and must seek care if they develop symptoms and wear face masks and wash hands.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to limit transmission to vulnerable close-contacts, such as those with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, HIV), and the elderly (>= 60 years).\n\nREF: WHO/2019-nCov/IPC/HomeCare/2020.3"

      "description": "Gastrointestinal bleeding can present as blood in stool or vomit.\n\nBlood in stool: Severe gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in the case of intestinal obstruction (intussusception) in which the child most often presents with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargic, and bloody stools (like \"currant jelly\"). \n\nBlood in vomit: Severe gastrointestinal bleeding, presents as large quantity of blood in the vomit and can be due to rupture of esophageal varices, or injury of the esophagus from a foreign object (less commonly gastritis).\n\nNote, not all blood in stool or vomit is gastro-intestinal bleeding, and it is not always severe. Other causes include dysentery, milk or soy induced colitis, anal fissures, epistaxis, or ingesting food that resembles blood.",

      "label": "Skin pinch goes back very slowly (>2 seconds)",
      "description": "This skin pinch tests is an important tool for testing dehydration. When a child is dehydrated, the skin loses elasticity. \n\nTo assess dehydration using the skin pinch: \n1.ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap.\n2.USE  YOUR  THUMB  AND  FIRST  FINGER  to  locate  the  area  on  the  child’s  abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5. LOOK  to  see  if  the  skin  pinch  goes  back  very  slowly  (more  than  2  seconds),  slowly, (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In a child is overweight or has oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. However you should still use it to classify the child’s dehydration.

Of note, few patients with COVID-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nIf the patient will be self-isolated at home, the following recommendations should be followed:\n- Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (ideally in a different room from others)\n- Limit movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space (keep windows open) if sharing space.\n- Wash hands after any type of contact with the patient or their immediate environment.\n- A mask should be worn as much as possible by the patient.\n- Caregivers should wear a mask when in the same room as the patient.\n- Avoid direct contact with body fluids (oral respiratory secretions, and stool).\n- Avoid sharing potentially contaminated items (toothbrushes, eating utensils, towels, bed linen, washcloths, clothes)\n\nAdvise close contacts of the patient that they are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and must seek care if they develop symptoms and wear face masks and wash hands.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to limit transmission to vulnerable close-contacts, such as those with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, HIV), and the elderly (>= 60 years).\n\nREF: WHO/2019-nCov/IPC/HomeCare/2020.3",

Teach the mother to treat mouth ulcers with half-strength gentian violet. Gentian violet used in the mouth should be half-strength (0.25%), not full-strength (0.5%). Give the following information. Tell the mother:\n\n• Her child will start eating normally sooner if she paints \nthe mouth ulcers in her child’s mouth. It is important that the child \neats. • Clean the child’s mouth. Wrap a clean soft cloth around her finger. Dip it in salt water. Wipe the mouth.\n • Use a clean cloth or a cotton-tipped stick to paint \ngentian violet on the mouth ulcers. The gentian violet will kill germs \nthat cause the ulcers. Put a small amount of gentian violet on the cloth\n or stick. Do not let the child drink the gentian violet.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers 2 times per day, in the morning and evening.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers for 5 days and then stop.\n\nWrap a clean cloth around your finger and dip it into salt water. Show the mother how to first wipe the child’s mouth clean. Then paint half of the child’s mouth with halfstrength gentian violet.\n\nAsk the mother to practise. Watch her wipe the child’s mouth \nclean and paint the rest of the ulcers with gentian violet. Comment on \nthe steps she did well and those that need to be improved.\nGive the mother a bottle of half-strength gentian\n violet to take home. Tell her to return to the clinic if the mouth \nulcers get worse or if the child is not able to drink or eat.\nBefore the mother leaves, ask checking questions. For example, ask:\n\n“What will you use to clean the child’s mouth?”\n“When will you wash your hands?”\n“How often will you treat the child’s mouth?” “For how many days?”\nIf she anticipates any problems providing the treatment, help her to solve them.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nRepeat up to 3 times every 15 minutes before classifying pneumonia.\nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.\n(REF IMCI 2014)",

Teach the mother to treat mouth ulcers with half-strength gentian violet. Gentian violet used in the mouth should be half-strength (0.25%), not full-strength (0.5%). Give the following information. \n\nTell the mother:\n\n• Her child will start eating normally sooner if she paints the mouth ulcers in her child’s mouth. It is important that the child eats. \n• Clean the child’s mouth. Wrap a clean soft cloth around her finger. Dip it in salt water. Wipe the mouth.\n • Use a clean cloth or a cotton-tipped stick to paint gentian violet on the mouth ulcers. The gentian violet will kill germs that cause the ulcers. Put a small amount of gentian violet on the cloth or stick. Do not let the child drink the gentian violet.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers 2 times per day, in the morning and evening.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers for 5 days and then stop.\n\nWrap a clean cloth around your finger and dip it into salt water. Show the mother how to first wipe the child’s mouth clean. Then paint half of the child’s mouth with halfstrength gentian violet.\n\nAsk the mother to practise. Watch her wipe the child’s mouth clean and paint the rest of the ulcers with gentian violet. Comment on the steps she did well and those that need to be improved. Give the mother a bottle of half-strength gentian\n violet to take home. Tell her to return to the clinic if the mouth ulcers get worse or if the child is not able to drink or eat.\nBefore the mother leaves, ask checking questions. \nFor example, ask:\n\n“What will you use to clean the child’s mouth?”\n“When will you wash your hands?”\n“How often will you treat the child’s mouth?” “For how many days?”\nIf she anticipates any problems providing the treatment, help her to solve them.\"\n",

Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines",

The dose is about the size of a \ngrain of rice.\nIf the child is not being referred, teach the mother to apply the tetracycline eye ointment. Refer to the TREAT THE CHILD chart and give the mother the following information.\n\nTell the mother that she should treat both eyes to prevent damage\n to the eyes. Tell her also that the ointment will slightly sting the \nchild’s eye. Tell her to:\n\n• Wash her hands before and after treating the eye. • Clean the child’s eyes immediately before applying the tetracycline eye ointment. Use a clean cloth to wipe the eye.\n • Repeat the process (cleaning the eye and applying ointment) 3 times per day, in the morning, at mid-day and in the evening.\n\n\nThen show the mother how to treat the eye. Be sure to wash your hands.\n\n• Hold down the lower lid of your eye. Point to the lower \nlid. Tell the mother that this is where she should apply the ointment. \nTell her to be careful that the tube does not touch the eye or lid. • Have someone hold the child still.\n • Wipe one of the child’s eyes with the cloth. Squirt \nthe ointment onto the lower lid. Make sure the mother sees where to \napply the ointment and the amount (the size of a grain of rice).\n\nAsk the mother to practise cleaning and applying \nthe eye ointment into the child’s other eye. Observe and give feedback \nas she practices. When she is finished, give her the following \nadditional information.\n\n• Treat both eyes until the redness is gone from the infected eye. The infected eye is improving if there is less pus in the eye or the eyes are not stuck shut in the morning. • Do not put\n any other eye ointments, drops or alternative treatments in the child’s\n eyes. They may be harmful and damage the child’s eyes. Putting harmful \nsubstances in the eye may cause blindness.\n • After 2 days, if there is still pus in the eye, bring the child back to the clinic.\n\nThen give the mother the tube of ointment to take home. \nGive her the same tube you used to treat the child in the clinic. Before\n the mother leaves, ask checking questions. Check that she understands how to treat the eye. For example, ask:\n\n“Will you treat one or both eyes?”\n“How much ointment you will put in the eyes? Show me.”\n“How often will you treat the eyes?”\n“When will you wash your hands?”",

During the next day, the rash spreads to the rest of the body, arms and legs. After 4 to 5 days, the rash starts to fade and the skin may peel. Some children with severe infection may have more rash spread over more of the body. The rash becomes more discolored(dark brown or blackish), and there is more peeling of the skin.\nA measles rash does not have vesicles (blisters) or pustules. The rash does not itch. Do not confuse measles with other common childhood rashes such as chicken pox, scabies or heat rash. \nThe rash is often associated with red eyes, runny nose or cough.\nREF Adapted from IMCI 2014",
