No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nRepeat up to 3 times every 15 minutes before classifying pneumonia.\nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.\n(REF IMCI 2014)"

Hold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. The scalpel blade should be perpendicular to the skin.\n– The incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. The incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted.\n– Be cautious when excising an abscess located over a blood vessel (carotid, axillary, humeral, femoral, popliteal).\n\nDigital exploration:\n– Explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus and explore to the edges of the cavity.\n– The exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical advice.\n\nWashing:\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with antiseptic solution.\n\nDrainage:\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\n\nREF MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Hold the abscess between the thumb and index finger of the other hand. The scalpel blade should be perpendicular to the skin.\n– The incision is made in a single stroke along the long axis of the abscess. The incision must be long enough for a finger to be inserted.\n– Be cautious when excising an abscess located over a blood vessel (carotid, axillary, humeral, femoral, popliteal).\n\nDigital exploration:\n– Explore the cavity with the index finger, breaking down all loculi (a single cavity should remain), evacuate the pus and explore to the edges of the cavity.\n– The exploration also allows an assessment of the extent of the abscess, the depth, and location with respect to underlying structures (arterial pulsation) or any possible contact with underlying bone. In this last case, seek surgical advice.\n\nWashing:\nAbundant washing of the cavity using a syringe filled with antiseptic solution.\n\nDrainage:\nInsert a drain (or, failing that a gauze wick) into the base of the cavity. If possible, fix it to the edge of the incision with a single suture. The drain is withdrawn progressively and then, after 3 to 5 days removed completely.\n\nREF MSF Clinical Guidelines"

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

Remove the dipstick from the solution and place it in a horizontal position.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n-        Read results within 5 minutes. Do not pay attention to any lines appearing later than 5 minutes. \n-        The red (control) line confirms the correct performance of the test.\n-        If, in addition to the red control line there are\no        no blue lines, the serum CRP concentration of the sample is \u003c10 mg/l\no        one blue line, the serum CRP concentration is 10-40 mg/l\no        two blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is 40-80 mg/l\no        three blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is \u003e80 mg/l\n-        If the red (control) line does not appear, the test is invalid and the test must be performed again.\n-        Document the results of the test as per usual health facility procedures with the result CRP \u003c10mg/l, CRP 10-40mg/l, or CRP \u003e80mg/l",

After proper use, assess if there is a subjective improvement (child describes an improvement of breathing) or objective improvement (respiratory rate reduces, or chest indrawing stops)\n\nUSE OF A SPACER*\nA spacer is a way of delivering the bronchodilator drugs effectively into the lungs. No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.",

      "description": "In measles, a red rash begins 2 to 4 days after the start of a fever, starting behind the ears and on the neck. It spreads to the face. During the next day, the rash spreads to the rest of the body, arms and legs. After 4 to 5days, the rash starts to fade and the skin may peel. Some children with severe infection may have more rash spread over more of the body. The rash becomes more discolored(dark brown or blackish), and there is more peeling of the skin.\nA measles rash does not have vesicles (blisters) or pustules. The rash does not itch. Do not confuse measles with other common childhood rashes such as chicken pox, scabiesor heat rash. \nThe rash is often associated with red eyes, runny nose or cough.\nREF WHO IMCI Hanbook 2005",

Conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva, the inside surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eye. If you do not see pus draining from the eye, look for pus on the conjunctiva or on the eyelids. Often the pus forms a crust when the child is sleeping and seals the eye shut. You can gently open the eye, making sure that your hands are clean. Wash your hands after examining the eye of any child with pus draining from the eye. ",

      "description": "The cornea is usually clear. When clouding of the cornea is present, the cornea may appear clouded or hazy. The cornea may look the way a glass of water looks when you add a small amount of milk. The clouding may occur in one or both eyes. \nCorneal clouding is a dangerous condition. It may be the result of vitamin A deficiency that has been made worse by measles. If the corneal clouding is not treated, the cornea can ulcerate and cause blindness. \nA child with clouding of the cornea needs urgent treatment with vitamin A. A  child  with  corneal  clouding  may  keep  his  or  her  eyes  tightly  shut  when  exposed  to  light.  The  light  may  cause  irritation and pain to the child’s eyes. To check the child’s eye, wait for the child to open his or her eye. Or gently pull down the lower eyelid to look for clouding.\nIf there is clouding of the cornea, ask the caregiver how long the clouding has been present. If the caregiver is certain that clouding has been there for some time, ask if the clouding has already been assessed and treated at the hospital. If it has, you do not need to refer this child again for corneal clouding.",

      "description": "LOOK OR FEEL FOR STIFF NECK\n\nA child with fever and stiff neck may have meningitis. A child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to hospital.\n\nWhile you talk with the mother during the assessment, look to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiff neck.\n\nIf you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.\n\nIf you still have not seen the child bend his neck himself, ask the mother to help you lie the child on his back. Lean over the child, gently support his back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold his head. Then carefully bend the head forward toward his chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck. Often a child with a stiff neck will cry when you try to bend the neck. REF WHO IMCI Handbook 2005",

      "description": "This skin pinch tests is an important tool for testing dehydration. When a child is dehydrated, the skin loses elasticity. \n\nTo assess dehydration using the skin pinch: \n1.ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap.\n2.USE  YOUR  THUMB  AND  FIRST  FINGER  to  locate  the  area  on  the  child’s  abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5. LOOK  to  see  if  the  skin  pinch  goes  back  very  slowly  (more  than  2  seconds),  slowly, (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In a child is overweight or has oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. However you should still use it to classify the child’s dehydration.

If using whole blood, add 1 drop of chase buffer 1 minute after applying whole blood to pad. \n•        Interpret the results in 15 minutes.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:\n POSITIVE (two bars): Red bars appear in both the control window and the patient window of the strip. The test result is positive even if the patient bar appears lighter or darker than the control bar.\n\nNEGATIVE (one bar): One red bar appears in the control window of the strip and no red bar appears in the patient window of the strip.\n\nINVALID (no bar): If there is no red bar in the control window of the strip, and even if a red bar appears in the patient window of the strip, the result is invalid and should be repeated.  If it is still invalid don’t use the whole box of test kits from which the kit used was taken off.\n\n**Note, tests may be falsely negative in 20-30% of tests among patients with a primary syphilis lesion (chancre), another test in one week, or presumptive treatment may be warranted if suspicion is high.",

No child under 5 years\nshould be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.\n \nRepeat up to 3 times every 15 minutes before classifying pneumonia.\nSpacers can be made in the following way:\nUse a 500ml drink bottle or similar.\nCut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler.\nThis can be done using a sharp knife.\nCut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.\nCut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.\nFlame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.\nIn a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.\nAlternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\nTo use an inhaler with a spacer:\nRemove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.\nInsert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.\nThe child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.\nA carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.\nWait for three to four breaths and repeat.\n\nFor younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n* If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.\n(REF IMCI 2014)"

Teach the mother to treat mouth ulcers with half-strength gentian violet. Gentian violet used in the mouth should be half-strength (0.25%), not full-strength (0.5%). Give the following information. \n\nTell the mother:\n\n• Her child will start eating normally sooner if she paints the mouth ulcers in her child’s mouth. It is important that the child eats. \n• Clean the child’s mouth. Wrap a clean soft cloth around her finger. Dip it in salt water. Wipe the mouth.\n • Use a clean cloth or a cotton-tipped stick to paint gentian violet on the mouth ulcers. The gentian violet will kill germs that cause the ulcers. Put a small amount of gentian violet on the cloth or stick. Do not let the child drink the gentian violet.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers 2 times per day, in the morning and evening.\n • Treat the mouth ulcers for 5 days and then stop.\n\nWrap a clean cloth around your finger and dip it into salt water. Show the mother how to first wipe the child’s mouth clean. Then paint half of the child’s mouth with halfstrength gentian violet.\n\nAsk the mother to practise. Watch her wipe the child’s mouth clean and paint the rest of the ulcers with gentian violet. Comment on the steps she did well and those that need to be improved. Give the mother a bottle of half-strength gentian\n violet to take home. Tell her to return to the clinic if the mouth ulcers get worse or if the child is not able to drink or eat.\nBefore the mother leaves, ask checking questions. \nFor example, ask:\n\n“What will you use to clean the child’s mouth?”\n“When will you wash your hands?”\n“How often will you treat the child’s mouth?” “For how many days?”\nIf she anticipates any problems providing the treatment, help her to solve them.\"\n",

      "description": "Technique\n\n– Settle the patient comfortably in an area with good lighting and ensure all the necessary material is prepared.\n– Explain the procedure to the patient and ensure his co-operation.\n– If the patient is a young child, arrange to have an assistant hold the child if necessary.\nInitial cleaning\n\n– Wear suitable clothing: sterile gloves for all wounds and a gown and protective glasses if there is a risk of projection from a bleeding wound.\n– Start by washing the wound, prolong the cleaning if the wound is particularly soiled. Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

Putting harmful \nsubstances in the eye may cause blindness.\n • After 2 days, if there is still pus in the eye, bring the child back to the clinic.\n\nThen give the mother the tube of ointment to take home. \nGive her the same tube you used to treat the child in the clinic.

Use ordinary soap or 7.5% povidone iodine scrub solution and water and rinse.\n– If necessary use a sterile brush. Cleaning with running water is preferable to cleaning by immersion.\n– If the wound is infected and the patient has general signs of infection (fever, chills, changes in the overall condition) systemic antibiotic therapy may be required. Administer antibiotics at least one hour prior to starting care.\nExploration\n\n– Wash hands and put on sterile gloves.\n– Disinfect the wound and surrounding area with 10% povidone iodine.\n– Cover the wound with a fenestrated sterile towel.\n– Local anaesthetic: infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the edges of the wound and wait at least 2 minutes for the anaesthetic to take effect.\n– Proceed carefully from the superficial to the deepest parts of the wound to explore the extent of the wound, if necessary, aided by an assistant.\n– Consider the anatomical location of the wound and look for injury to any underlying structures (the clinical examination of a limb must include evaluation of sensitivity and motor functioning, as well as that of tendons in order to orient surgical exploration):\n• a wound that communicates with a fracture is an open fracture,\n• a wound close to a joint may be a joint wound,\n• a wound on the hands or feet may affect the nerves and/or tendons.\n– Look for and remove any foreign bodies.\n– In the event of significant pain or bleeding, the exploration must be completed in an operating room.\nWound excision\n\n– The goal of the excision is to remove non-viable tissue, which favours the proliferation of bacteria and infection.\n– The wound may require little or no excision if it is clean. The excision is more extensive if the wound is bruised, irregular or extensive.\n– Limit excision of the skin around the wound, particularly in facial wounds.\n– Sub-cutaneous fat and tissue of doubtful viability should be generously excised in order to leave only well vascularised tissue.\n\nREF: MSF Clinical Guidelines"

After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.

They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently.

However, they should still be encouraged to eat the types of food recommended for their age, as often as recommended, even if they do not eat much. They should be offered their favourite nutritious foods, if possible, to encourage eating. Offer small feedings frequently. After illness, good feeding helps make up for any weight loss and prevent malnutrition.\n\nDuring illness an infant or young child loses fluid due to fever, fast breathing, or diarrhoea. The child will feel better and stay stronger if he or she drinks extra fluid to prevent dehydration. Frequent breastfeeding will give the infant nourishment and help prevent dehydration.
