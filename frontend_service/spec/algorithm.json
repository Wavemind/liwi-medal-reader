Untreated, it can sometimes result in irreversible bone/ joint damage, sepsis and even death.  \n\nDiagnosis of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is complicated. Elevated CRP may help distinguish ostemoyelitis and septic arthritis from less severe acute limp or joint pain, and those needing antibiotics.","level_of_urgency":9,"medias":[{"label":"Osteomyelitis/septic arthritis diagram","url":"https://liwi-medias.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/url/38/Detailed_ePOCT%2B_20201127-Osteomyelitis_septic_arthritis_Limp-joint_pain.png?X-Amz-Expires=600\u0026X-Amz-Date=20210225T092058Z\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=AKIARGDHLEABIW5PPSNA%2F20210225%2Feu-central-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=556fb6f6c99052f4461d578a76552ae0315957e8529d0018775dc1d2b2fb3c3a","extension":"png"}],"type":"FinalDiagnostic","drugs":{"1712":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2889,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":3525,"score":null},{"first_id":1093,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2174,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":1712,"duration":"1","description":"Pre-referral treatment : Give the first dose of the medication before referring the child.

A child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to hospital.\n\nWhile you talk with the mother during the assessment, look to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiff neck.\n\nIf you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.\n\nIf you still have not seen the child bend his neck himself, ask the mother to help you lie the child on his back. Lean over the child, gently support his back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold his head. Then carefully bend the head forward toward his chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck. Often a child with a stiff neck will cry when you try to bend the neck.

When a child is dehydrated, the skin loses elasticity. \n\nTo assess dehydration using the skin pinch: \n1.ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap.\n2.USE  YOUR  THUMB  AND  FIRST  FINGER  to  locate  the  area  on  the  child’s  abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5. LOOK  to  see  if  the  skin  pinch  goes  back  very  slowly  (more  than  2  seconds),  slowly (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated. In a child is overweight or has oedema, the skin may go back immediately even if the child is dehydrated. However you should still use it to classify the child’s dehydration.

of the cornea","description":"The cornea is the part of the eye that covers the colored part; it is usually clear. When clouding of the cornea is present, the cornea may appear white clouded or hazy. The cornea may look the way a glass of water looks when you add a small amount of milk. The clouding may occur in one or both eyes. \nCorneal clouding is a dangerous condition. It may be the result of vitamin A deficiency that has been made worse by measles. If the corneal clouding is not treated, the cornea can ulcerate and cause blindness. \nA child with clouding of the cornea needs urgent treatment with vitamin A. A  child  with  corneal  clouding  may  keep  his  or  her  eyes  tightly  shut  when  exposed  to  light.  The  light  may  cause  irritation and pain to the child’s eyes. To check the child’s eye, wait for the child to open his or her eye. Or gently pull down the lower eyelid to look for clouding.\nIf there is clouding of the cornea, ask the caregiver how long the clouding has been present. If the caregiver is certain that clouding has been there for some time, ask if the clouding has already been assessed and treated at the hospital. If it has, you do not need to refer this child again for corneal clouding.\nREF IMCI 2014","is_mandatory":true,"emergency_status":"standard","is_neonat":false,"stage":"consultation","system":"visual","vital_signs":[],"category":"observed_physical_sign","is_triage":false,"is_identifiable":false,"is_danger_sign":false,"unavailable":false,"unavailable_label":"","estimable":false,"value_format":"Present","display_format":"RadioButton","qs":[{"id":3796,"conditionValue":null}],"dd":[],"df":[],"cc":[461],"conditioned_by_cc":[],"referenced_in":[],"counter":0,"value":null,"answer":null,"answers":{"288":{"id":288,"label":"Present","value":null,"operator":null},"289":{"id":289,"label":"Absent","value":null,"operator":null}},"reference_table_x_id":null,"reference_table_y_id":null,"reference_table_z_id":null,"reference_table_male":null,"reference_table_female":null,"min_value_warning":null,"max_value_warning":null,"min_value_error":null,"max_value_error":null,"min_message_warning":"","max_message_warning":"","min_message_error":"","max_message_error":"","medias":[]},"144":{"id":144,"type":"Question","label":"In-turned eye lashes","description":"Eyelashes grow toward the eye, with at least one eyelash rubbing on the eyeball ","is_mandatory":true,"emergency_status":"standard","is_neonat":false,"stage":"consultation","system":"visual","vital_signs":[],"category":"observed_physical_sign","is_triage":false,"is_identifiable":false,"is_danger_sign":false,"unavailable":false,"unavailable_label":"","estimable":false,"value_format":"Boolean","display_format":"RadioButton","qs":[{"id":3796,"conditionValue":null}],"dd":[],"df":[],"cc":[461],"conditioned_by_cc":[],"referenced_in":[],"counter":0,"value":null,"answer":null,"answers":{"298":{"id":298,"label":"Yes","value":null,"operator":null},"299":{"id":299,"label":"No","value":null,"operator":null}},"reference_table_x_id":null,"reference_table_y_id":null,"reference_table_z_id":null,"reference_table_male":null,"reference_table_female":null,"min_value_warning":null,"max_value_warning":null,"min_value_error":null,"max_value_error":null,"min_message_warning":"","max_message_warning":"","min_message_error":"","max_message_error":"","medias":[]},"3819":{"id":3819,"type":"Question","label":"Widal test","description":"Of note, the widal test is not very reliable as the sensitivity and specificity of the test is very low.

This means that antibiotics may not work when they are really needed. \nReassure the patient and caretaker that antibiotics are not needed, and remind them of when to return to consultation if the child presents new symptoms, or does not get better."}},"excluding_final_diagnostics":[],"excluded_final_diagnostics":[294,171,209,208],"cc":12,"instances":{}},"4579":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":2245,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2967,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"diagnostic_id":2274,"id":4579,"label":"Improved jaundice","description":null,"level_of_urgency":3,"medias":[],"type":"FinalDiagnostic","drugs":{},"managements":{"4581":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":3247,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":4580,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":4581,"duration":null,"description":null},"4582":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":3247,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":4580,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":4582,"duration":null,"description":null},"4583":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":3248,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":4580,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":4583,"duration":null,"description":null},"4584":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":3248,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":4580,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":4584,"duration":null,"description":null}},"excluding_final_diagnostics":[2964,2965],"excluded_final_diagnostics":[2963],"cc":4547,"instances":{"4580":{"top_conditions":[],"conditions":[],"id":4580,"children":[4581,4582,4583,4584],"final_diagnostic_id":4579}}},"193":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":155,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":91,"score":null},{"first_id":160,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":93,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"diagnostic_id":20,"id":193,"label":"Severe malaria","description":null,"level_of_urgency":10,"medias":[{"label":"Severe malaria diagram","url":"https://liwi-medias.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/media/url/149/Detailed_ePOCT%2B_20210112-Copy_of_Malaria.png?X-Amz-Expires=600\u0026X-Amz-Date=20210225T092054Z\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=AKIARGDHLEABIW5PPSNA%2F20210225%2Feu-central-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=42ed63b0051827ab167388018b984cebcb338845194f3ee3a5dbe97cac6d93ee","extension":"png"}],"type":"FinalDiagnostic","drugs":{"1708":{"top_conditions":[{"first_id":1168,"first_type":"Answer","first_node_id":2252,"score":null}],"conditions":[],"id":1708,"duration":"1","description":"Pre-referral treatment: Give the first dose of the medication before referring the child.
